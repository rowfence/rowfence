  tagline: Write who can do what in one small file. rowfence compiles it into row-level security, and Postgres enforces it on every query.

features:
  - title: One policy file
    details: Relations read from your own columns and tables, permissions built from them, inherited down trees of folders or teams, and a rule for each table command.
  - title: Enforced by Postgres
    details: Row-level security filters every read and checks every write. The app signs in each transaction and queries its tables as usual. A refused write says which rule and why.
  - title: Ships as migrations
    details: Each change to the policy is a migration for the tool your app already uses (Alembic, Prisma, Drizzle Kit, SQL, goose, dbmate, Flyway). Any Postgres 16, 17 or 18. No extension, no superuser.
  - title: Tested like code
    details: Tests next to the policy, invariants checked in many small worlds, and a review of each change that says who gains or loses access.

## A small policy

```authz
app role app_user                               -- the Postgres role the app connects as
type user = app.users
type folder = app.folders
  owner  : user   = owner_id                    -- a relation read from a column
  parent : folder = parent_id
  editor : user   = app.folder_editors(folder_id -> user_id)   -- ... or from a link table
  can edit = owner or editor or parent.edit     -- inherited down the tree
  can view = edit
rules app.folders
  select : view
  update : edit
```

The app says who is asking, then runs its usual queries:

```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT authz.act_as('user', '42');
SELECT * FROM app.folders;                      -- only the folders 42 may view
UPDATE app.folders SET name = 'Plans' WHERE id = 7;   -- 0 rows unless 42 may edit folder 7
COMMIT;
```

The SDKs turn a write that changed nothing into a 404 (the row can't be seen) or a 403 that says which rule
refused it and why.

Next: [Getting started](../docs/getting-started.md) goes from a schema to a policy, its tests, the edit loop and
the first migration. [Pick your stack](../docs/stacks/README.md) for the SDK that does the signing in for you.
