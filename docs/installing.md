# Installing

rowstile is a command, `rowstile`, and an SDK for your app's language. Nothing is installed in the database:
the command writes migrations, and your migration tool runs them as the owner of your tables. Any PostgreSQL
16, 17 or 18 works, managed or not.

## The command

Only an alpha is published so far, 0.1.0-alpha.4, and a plain install doesn't get it. Ask for it:

    npm i -D rowstile@next         # the command with its own Python: a TypeScript app needs none
    pip install --pre rowstile     # the command and the Python SDK: rowstile[fastapi], [sqlalchemy], ...
    docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/work" ghcr.io/rowstile/rowstile:0.1.0-alpha.4 migrate

Once 0.1.0 is out, the plain `npm i -D rowstile`, `pip install rowstile` and `ghcr.io/rowstile/rowstile` get
it.

- **npm**: the package brings a Python of its own, built for your machine: Linux (glibc and musl, x64 and
  arm64), macOS (x64 and arm64) and Windows x64. Run it as `npx rowstile`, or from a script in `package.json`.
- **pip**: Python 3.11 or newer. The same package is the [Python SDK](../sdk/python/README.md), and its extras
  bring what each part of it uses: `rowstile[fastapi]`, `rowstile[sqlalchemy]`, `rowstile[psycopg]`,
  `rowstile[asyncpg]`. The command needs none of them.
- **Docker**: the image holds the command and git (`rowstile review` asks git for the base branch's files),
  and works in the folder mounted at `/work`. It runs as root unless told otherwise: `-u` makes the files it
  writes yours.

`rowstile --version` says which version runs, and on which Python.

## Alphas and release candidates

A version that isn't final is never what a plain install gets. Ask for it:

    npm i -D rowstile@next
    pip install --pre rowstile

and the image by its version (`ghcr.io/rowstile/rowstile:0.2.0-rc.1`). An alpha is for trying a version
early: anything in it may still change. A release candidate is meant to become the release as it is.
[The changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) says what each version changed, and under **Upgrading** what to do when
moving to it.

## From the repository

    git clone https://github.com/rowstile/rowstile
    export PATH="$PWD/rowstile/core/cli:$PATH"

The command is Python 3.11 or newer and its standard library: there is nothing else to install.

## Then

`rowstile init` finds the stack (Next.js, Prisma, Drizzle, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic), writes
`rowstile.toml` for its migration tool, adds the SDK's packages and says which line to change.

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): from a schema to a policy, its tests, the edit loop and the first
  migration.
- [Your stack](stacks/README.md): the SDK's packages for it ([Python](../sdk/python/README.md),
  [TypeScript](../sdk/typescript/README.md)), and where each line goes.
- [Editors](../editor/README.md): highlighting and the language server for VS Code, Zed, Helix and Neovim.
