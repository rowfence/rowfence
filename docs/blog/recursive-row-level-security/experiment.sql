-- The experiment behind "Why a recursive row-level security policy is slow, and what fixes it".
-- Folders in a tree, files in folders, and one rule: you see a file if you own its folder or any folder above
-- it. The rule is written four ways, and the same three queries are timed through each.
--
--   createdb rls_tree && psql -X -d rls_tree -v folders=20000 -f experiment.sql
--
-- It makes a schema `demo` and a role `demo_app`, and drops neither. PostgreSQL 16 or later. Each query runs
-- three times; read the last "Execution Time" of each.
