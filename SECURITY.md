# Security

rowstile decides who may read and change which rows. A flaw in it can expose data, so please report one
privately, not in a public issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: the repository's **Security** tab, then **Report a
vulnerability**. Only you and the maintainers see the report. Once it's fixed, it can be published as an
advisory, with credit to you if you want it.

A report is easiest to act on with:

- the smallest policy, schema and data that show it;
- what you ran, as which role, and who was signed in (`authz.act_as`, an API key or a JWT);
- what happened, and what the policy says should have;
- the rowstile and PostgreSQL versions (`rowstile --version`, `SELECT version()`).

## What counts

[The threat model](docs/threat-model.md) draws the line: what rowstile protects, who is trusted, and the
limits it accepts. In short, a vulnerability is anything that lets the app role, or someone signed in with an
API key or a JWT, do more than the policy allows. Some examples:

- read, change or delete a row the rules don't allow, read a column a mask hides, or change one a column rule
  protects;
- act as someone else, widen a key's scopes, or write during "view as";
- share more than they hold, approve their own request, or reach rowstile's internal tables and functions;
- a policy that compiles and applies without an error, but grants more than it says.

The limits listed in the threat model are known and accepted (side channels such as `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, tables
without rules, `SECURITY DEFINER` functions the app adds). A way around one of them that the threat model
doesn't describe is still worth a report.

## Supported versions

Before 1.0, fixes go into the latest release only.
