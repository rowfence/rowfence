"""rowstile prove: every invariant checked in many small worlds, with no database.

An invariant (`never folder: share and not org.member`) says no one may ever hold that on any object. The
reference evaluator (evaluate.py) computes what the policy grants in made-up worlds, smallest first (1 object
of each type, then up to 4, every kind of link and share, columns that simple conditions read, every other
{condition} true or false per row), as each
person who can sign in and as nobody. At each size, worlds drawn row by row take turns with the corners
(evaluate.corners: each condition true on every row or on none): a counterexample that needs several conditions to
hold at once is rare in a draw (one world in nine for two coin tosses of three values, per row), and found in a
corner in a few worlds. Then the worlds a draw rarely makes (evaluate.rare_worlds): dense ones, where a link table
holds half its links or nearly all (a long `and` of links), and, for a policy that reads 2 links deep or more, chains
one link longer than it reads. A world where someone holds it is a counterexample, shrunk link by link
to the smallest that still breaks the invariant, and printed as a reviewer can read it. The same engine checks
that a refactor changed nothing in rowstile review.
