"""check_counts: how many checks each suite passes is written down, and changes only on purpose.

    python3 tests/check_counts.py LOG [LOG ...]      # core/ci.sh runs it on run_tests.sh's log
    python3 tests/check_counts.py --write LOG [...]  # after adding or taking away checks on purpose

A suite that stops checking something can stay green: a glob that matches nothing, a loop over an empty list, a
suite cut short. run_tests.sh's log says how many checks each one passed (a line `ok ...` each, `N checks passed`,
`Ran N tests`, `N of N cases`) before the step's `--- passed: NAME` line, and check_counts.txt says how many each
one passes: no fewer and no more, so that a count that changes is in the diff, like the golden SQL. A suite a log
doesn't have (a part of the run, a shorter mode) isn't asked. The random ones (difftest, genpolicy, around, the
conditions, the parser fuzzer, the stress test) check as many things as their seeds draw: they aren't counted.
