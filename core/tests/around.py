"""around: random policies (tests/genpolicy.py), with what is around the policy drawn at random too.

    python3 tests/around.py --db authz_around --policies 10 --steps 6 --seed 1

difftest and genpolicy compare two evaluations of one policy on data they made, always the same way: plain
tables, the owner's session switched to the app role, a database nobody else was given anything in. Most of the
holes the bug hunt found were not in the policy's logic but around it. So each seed here takes genpolicy's
policy for that seed and draws a world for it:

  the catalog   each object table is plain, partitioned by its key (hash or range: a key that changes puts the
                row in another partition), or has a table that inherits from it, where half its rows are stored;
                the owner's default privileges give new tables, functions and schemas to the app role, to PUBLIC
                or to a role the policy doesn't name; conditions name the app's table and function without their
                schema, which the database's search path supplies; a schema on that path that others may create in
  the session   who connects: the owner switched to the app role (as the other suites do), a login role that is
                a member of the app role, or one that has to SET ROLE to it; the last two sign each user in with
                authz.act_as(). Settings of the app's transaction that must change no answer: planner switches,
                read-only, how dates and identifiers are written, a search path that starts with a schema of
                decoys (a table, a function and an operator named as the policy's, a now() of its own)
  later         halfway, something changes behind the policy's back: a grant on rowstile's own objects,
                row-level security turned off, a table made under a governed one, CREATE on a schema of the path

and checks, after each random change to the data:

  - difftest's checks (lists, can, the rows each rule allows, explain, who, verify), the app role's answers
    asked in the world's session
  - real writes as the app role, each undone: an update that changes nothing, an update of a column with a rule,
    a delete, calls of authz.share() to three users, on every row and for every user, against what the reference
    evaluator says of the rules and of who may share, and what the relation's `shared if` says of the share; and
    the tables under a governed one, read and written directly
  - no share is left on a row that is gone or whose key changed
  - a role the policy doesn't name gets no row of a governed table, whatever it was granted there, and a
    member of the app role that didn't sign in gets an error (28000) or nothing, never a row
  - the privileges on authz, authz_gen and authz_int are the ones a database with no world around it has
  - what changed behind the policy's back: authz.lint() reports it, and `rowstile apply` puts it right (or
    refuses, AZ612, for the schema others may create in) and then answers `unchanged`

A failing seed is printed with its world and its policy; --only SEED runs it again. Then the world is made
plainer, one thing at a time, while it still fails.
