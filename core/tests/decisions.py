"""decisions: which parts of a policy decided an answer in difftest's worlds.

    python3 tests/difftest.py --gen docs --steps 100 --decisions
    python3 tests/genpolicy.py --policies 12 --steps 8 --decisions

difftest holds the database's answers to the reference evaluator's (authzlib/evaluate.py) after each random change.
A part of the policy whose value never changed an answer there is one whose SQL was never judged: a mistake in it
(a mutant) would pass. So, over every snapshot and every principal asked, each part is watched: did it hold for some
(principal, object), fail for some, and decide an answer? Deciding is forcing it the other way, one more evaluation
with that part overridden (true on every row, or on none), and some answer difftest compares changes: a permission
held on an object, a row a rule allows. The parts:

  - each part of each permission's and each rule's expression (`parent.view`, `{inherit}`, `not hidden`);
  - each source of each relation, by the subject it names (a user, a service, a group, user:*, anyone, a link, an
    object that `parent.view` follows), the subjects of custom roles, and their `from`;
  - each type's where;
  - each share that doesn't count, had it counted (expired, not started yet, a caveat that doesn't hold), and each
    that counts by a caveat that holds, had it not;
  - each item of each scope, and what a scope leaves out (difftest asks one principal a snapshot with a scope);
  - each recursion's depth (inheritance, and groups inside groups: 1, 2, 3 or more links deep) and a loop in the
    data that it goes round.

The report says, per policy, by name and line, the parts never true, never false, never decisive, and those decisive
one way only: a mutant forcing them the other way would pass too. A part is forced only until it has decided (each
way), and only for a principal for whom forcing changes it at all, so the cost falls as a run goes on.
