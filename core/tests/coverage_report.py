"""coverage_report: what the suites run of authzlib and cli, and what nothing runs.

    python3 tests/coverage_report.py [--out DIR] [--diff REF] DIR [DIR ...]

Each DIR is one that run_tests.sh measured into (ROWSTILE_COVERAGE=DIR; core/ci.sh --coverage makes
.ci/coverage-<version>), whose data/ holds a file per Python process the suites started, or such a data folder
itself (CI's parts). Run it where coverage.py is (the image core/Dockerfile builds with COVERAGE=1). It combines
them into --out (the first DIR if not given): .coverage, coverage.json (coverage.py's report) and report.txt:

  - for each file, its lines and branches, and how many of them the suites run (this part is printed too);
  - the lines and branches nothing runs, with their text, the files with the most first;
  - compiled, never judged: what runs of the code that writes the SQL deciding who may do what (DECIDES), but only
    in steps that don't compare the database's answers with the reference evaluator (ORACLE): its SQL was made,
    and difftest, genpolicy and around never judged it;
  - what the database runs: the kinds of rowstile's functions (authz_gen."<table>:update:refuse", a tree's
    refresh, authz.share) no suite ever called, from the counts tests/coverage_functions.sh kept (functions.tsv
    beside each DIR or data file).

With --diff REF it also prints the lines changed since REF (git diff REF...HEAD) that nothing runs, and exits 1 if
there are any.
