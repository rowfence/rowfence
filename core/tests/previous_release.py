"""previous_release: the release of rowstile before this checkout's version, installed from PyPI into a virtual
environment of its own, for tests/upgrade.sh to make a database with.

    python3 tests/previous_release.py DIR     # prints the version it installed, as the command writes it

The release before is the newest version PyPI has that is older than this checkout's (authzlib.__version__). A
version's alphas come before its candidates, and those before the version itself; a build of main (X.Y.Z-dev) is on
its way to X.Y.Z, after each alpha and candidate of it that is out. Its wheel is checked against the SHA-256 PyPI's
index gives, and its files are put in DIR, a virtual environment made without pip: a wheel of pure Python is its
files, and the image the suites run in has no pip. `DIR/bin/python -m rowstile` is then that release's command.

Exit 0: installed, and its version printed. Exit 2: nothing to upgrade from here, and why (PyPI can't be reached,
or has no release before this one): the suite says so and skips. Exit 1: anything else (PyPI answered something
this doesn't read, or a wheel that isn't the one the index names).
