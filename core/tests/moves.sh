# moves.sh: moves and links of folders with many below them. Such changes shift the stored inheritance
# rows (trees.py, _shift) instead of recomputing everything below; this checks that the shift is taken
# (rows inside the moved part are left alone), that it falls back when a link loops back into the moved
# part, and that the inheritance tables match a rebuild after every change.
