# children.sh: tables under a governed table (tests/children_schema.sql, tests/children.authz): the partitions
# of a partitioned table, and a table that inherits from one. Postgres runs a table's row triggers on its
# partitions (it copies them there) but not for rows stored in a table that inherits from it; and an update that
# puts a row in another partition is a delete there and an insert here, with no AFTER UPDATE row trigger.
# What rowstile keeps with row triggers has to hold for those rows too: a rule on a column, forgetting a row's
# shares when its key changes, the audit line of a changed relationship column.
