# upgrade.sh: databases the release before this one made, upgraded by this checkout's command. The release before
# (the newest on PyPI older than this version: tests/previous_release.py installs it) makes the docs app's database
# the ways an app keeps one: a development database it pushes to, as rowstile dev does; databases it applies the
# policy to, for an app without migrations (two: one for each way docs/operations.md upgrades them); and one the
# migrations and lock file its rowstile migrate writes set up. Under it the app shares, makes an API key and asks
# for access. Then this checkout's command upgrades each as the app would: push; apply, or reapply (the policy the
# database holds); and the next migration from the old lock file. Each database then holds what applying this
# version on a new one leaves, the policy's tests and the docs scenario pass, and what the app made before is still
# there and still in force. Where PyPI can't be reached, it says so and skips.
