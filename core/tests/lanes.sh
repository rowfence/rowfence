# in ROWSTILE_LANES lanes side by side, against the same server: 3 unless it says (CI's runners have 4 cores); 1:
# each step after the other, in the order run_tests.sh writes them. Each lane runs a fixed list: the part's units,
# the longest first to the lane with least to do so far. Steps that share a database or a file are one unit, in
# one lane; no two units share either (each suite's databases, roles and files have names of its own). A step's
# output is kept until it ends, then printed whole, in the order the steps are written (a whole run: part after
# part), so the log reads as one step after the other does; a `--- passed:` line's seconds are while others ran.
# Uses run_tests.sh's `failed` and STEPS_RUN, and its `record` calls lane_next after each result.
