The database is --db DSN (host=... port=... user=... password=... dbname=..., or a postgresql:// URL), else
rowstile.toml's `database` (in this folder or a folder above it), else DATABASE_URL, else the PG* environment variables.
Without --db, those variables may be in .env.local or .env beside rowstile.toml: the environment first, then the files.
rowstile.toml:

    policy   = "db/policy.authz"
    tests    = ["db/tests/*.authz"]
    database = "env:DATABASE_URL"          # a DSN or URL, or env:NAME for an environment variable holding one
    [clients]
    py = "backend/app/authz_client.py"
    ts = "frontend/src/authz.ts"
    [migrations]
    tool = "alembic"                       # alembic, prisma, drizzle, sql, goose, dbmate or flyway
    dir  = "alembic/versions"              # where the tool keeps them (each tool has a default)
    lock = "db/policy.lock"                # what the migrations made so far (default: next to the policy)
    write_after = 300                      # rowstile dev writes the migration this long after the last save
                                           # (seconds; 0: never, run rowstile migrate yourself)

The compiler runs here: the database only runs the SQL it writes, and the authz.* functions
apps call. Applying, previewing and testing each run in one transaction on the database.
