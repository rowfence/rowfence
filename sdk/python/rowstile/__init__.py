"""rowstile for Python apps.

Every transaction signs in as whoever the request (or the job) acts for, with `authz.act_as()`; the database's
refusals become `Refused` (a 403 with the reason), rows the user can't see become `NotFound` (a 404). The
package holds no rowstile logic: it calls the `authz.*` functions the policy made, and translates their answers.

    import rowstile
    with rowstile.acting_as(42):                  # or ("service", 3), or None for nobody
        ...                                       # every transaction in here signs in as user 42

The integrations: `rowstile.fastapi` (one line: Rowstile(app, engine, user=...)), `rowstile.sqlalchemy` (sync
and async engines, SQLModel too), `rowstile.psycopg`, `rowstile.asyncpg`, `rowstile.alembic` (autogenerate
leaves rowstile's objects alone) and `rowstile.testing` (pytest fixtures).
