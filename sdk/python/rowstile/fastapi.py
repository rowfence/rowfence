"""rowstile with FastAPI: one line.

    app = FastAPI()
    authz = Rowstile(app, engine, user=current_user)   # current_user(request): its user's id; before adding routes

Each request acts for user(request) (a user id, ("service", 3), a Principal, or None for nobody; it may be
async), so every transaction it begins on `engine` signs in as them. A refused write answers 403 with the
reason (an RFC 9457 problem body), a row the user can't see 404. At start-up the app refuses to run on a
connection that skips row-level security (authz.connection_check()), with or without a lifespan of its own.

user(request) runs in a middleware this adds: read the session or the token from the request itself. What a
middleware of the app's puts on request.state is there only if it was added after Rowstile(...) (Starlette
runs the one added last first). It may raise an HTTPException (a 401 for a bad token), which is answered as
it is. WebSockets are not signed in: use rowstile.acting_as() in the endpoint.
