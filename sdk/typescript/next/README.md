# @rowstile/next

[rowstile](https://rowstile.dev) is a policy language for PostgreSQL. You write who may see and change each
row in one file, and it becomes row-level security: the database filters every read and refuses every write
the rules don't allow, whatever the code asks.

This package is rowstile for Next.js (App Router). Importing it keeps signed-in reads out of Next's caches.
`route(handler)` answers a refusal with 403 and a hidden row with 404 (and what a call names that isn't there
404, a missing or wrong argument 400). `action(fn)` gives a server action's
refusal back as a value. `authzRoutes()` is what the React kit calls, and `checkAtStart()` stops a server
whose connection skips row-level security. It goes with a driver package, most often `@rowstile/prisma`.

```sh
# @next on each while only an alpha is published: a plain install gets an older one
npm install @rowstile/next@next @rowstile/prisma@next
npm install --save-dev rowstile@next      # the command: rowstile dev, rowstile migrate
```

A route handler with no checks: a hidden note is 404, one the user may not edit 403 with the reason.

```ts
import { route } from "@rowstile/next";
import { db } from "@/db";

type Params = { params: Promise<{ id: string }> };

export const PATCH = route(async (req: Request, { params }: Params) => {
  const id = Number((await params).id);
  const { body } = (await req.json()) as { body: string };
  await db.note.update({ where: { id }, data: { body } });
  return Response.json({ id });
});
```

A server action: Next.js hides a thrown error's message, so the refusal comes back as `{ ok: false, problem }`.

```ts
// app/actions.ts
import { action } from "@rowstile/next";

export const renameNote = action(async (id: number, body: string) => {
  await db.note.update({ where: { id }, data: { body } });
  return id;
});
```

At start-up:

```ts
// instrumentation.ts
import { checkAtStart } from "@rowstile/next";

export async function register() {
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === "nodejs") await checkAtStart((await import("./src/db.ts")).db.$authz);
}
```

## Good to know

- Before a transaction signs in as someone, it calls Next's `connection()`: the render is dynamic, and a
  signed-in read inside `"use cache"` or `unstable_cache` fails instead of being cached for the next user.
  Reads as nobody may be cached.
- `authzRoutes({ calls, changes })` in `app/api/authz/[...authz]/route.ts` serves `@rowstile/react`:
  permissions for a list, shares, access requests, live updates.
