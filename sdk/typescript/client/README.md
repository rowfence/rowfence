# @rowstile/client

[rowstile](https://rowstile.dev) is a policy language for PostgreSQL. You write who may see and change each
row in one file, and it becomes row-level security: the database filters every read and refuses every write
the rules don't allow, whatever the code asks.

This package is the base of the TypeScript SDK: who a transaction acts for, the errors a refusal becomes, and
the runtime's calls (`can`, `perms`, `list`, `share`, ...). The driver packages build on it: `@rowstile/prisma`,
`@rowstile/pg`, `@rowstile/postgres`, `@rowstile/drizzle`. It holds no rowstile logic: it calls the `authz.*`
functions the policy made, and translates their answers.

```sh
# @next while only an alpha is published: a plain install gets an older one
npm install @rowstile/client@next
npm install --save-dev rowstile@next      # the command: rowstile dev, rowstile migrate
```

A background job that acts for a service, whatever started it:

```ts
// src/jobs.ts
import { current, job } from "@rowstile/client";
import { db } from "./db.ts";

export const digest = job(["service", 1], async () => ({ count: await db.project.count(), who: current() }));
```

## What is in it

- `actingAs(who, fn)` and `job(who, fn)`: every transaction `fn` begins signs in as `who`. `42` or `"42"` is
  a user, `["service", 3]` another principal type of the policy, `null` nobody.
- `current()`: who the code running now acts for.
- `Refused` (403, with the rule and the reason), `NotFound` (404), `NotSignedIn`, `ConnectionProblem`.
- `translate(e)`: any driver's error as one of those, or `null`. `problemOf(e)` and `problemResponse(e)`: the
  status and an RFC 9457 body for an HTTP answer (and 404 for what a call names that isn't there, AZ708; 400
  for a missing or wrong argument, AZ710; 401 for a call that needs someone signed in or a login refused,
  AZ714 and AZ703; 409 for a move inside itself, AZ713).
- `errorCode(e)`: rowstile's code for an error (`AZ709`; `rowstile help AZ709` explains it).
- `calls(queryable)`: the runtime's functions over anything with `query(text, values)`.
- `Register`: the interface the generated names fill in (`rowstile client`), so a wrong permission name
  doesn't type-check.
