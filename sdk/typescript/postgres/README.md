# @rowstile/postgres

[rowstile](https://rowstile.dev) is a policy language for PostgreSQL. You write who may see and change each
row in one file, and it becomes row-level security: the database filters every read and refuses every write
the rules don't allow, whatever the code asks.

This package is rowstile for postgres.js. `authz(sql)` gives `begin(fn)`, a transaction that signs in as
whoever the code acts for, the runtime's calls (`can`, `permsOf`, `list`, `share`), and `expect`, which turns
an UPDATE or DELETE that changed nothing into `NotFound` or `Refused` with the reason.

```sh
# @next on each while only an alpha is published: a plain install gets an older one
npm install @rowstile/client@next @rowstile/postgres@next
npm install --save-dev rowstile@next      # the command: rowstile dev, rowstile migrate
```

```ts
import { authz as postgresAuthz } from "@rowstile/postgres";

    const sql = postgres(APP, { max: 2 });
    const a = postgresAuthz(sql);
      const projects = await actingAs(["service", 1], () => a.begin(async (tx) => tx`SELECT id FROM app.projects ORDER BY id`));
```

A DELETE the rules refuse deletes 0 rows, without an error; `expect` asks the database why:

```ts
      await expect(a.begin(async (tx) => tx`DELETE FROM app.notes WHERE id = 1 RETURNING id`.then((rows) =>
        a.expect(rows, "app.notes", "delete", 1)), "2")).rejects.toBeNotFound();
```

## Good to know

- `begin(fn, who)` signs in as `who`, or as whoever `actingAs` set (`@rowstile/client`), else nobody.
- Every transaction signs in, even as nobody, and nothing uses a session-level `SET`: poolers in transaction
  mode are safe.
- `await a.check()` at start-up throws `ConnectionProblem` on a connection that skips row-level security.
