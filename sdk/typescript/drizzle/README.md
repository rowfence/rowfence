# @rowstile/drizzle

[rowstile](https://rowstile.dev) is a policy language for PostgreSQL. You write who may see and change each
row in one file, and it becomes row-level security: the database filters every read and refuses every write
the rules don't allow, whatever the code asks.

This package is rowstile for Drizzle ORM, on node-postgres or postgres.js. `withAuthz(db)` gives Drizzle's
transactions a sign-in. `inIds(column, type, perm)` filters a query to the objects the user holds a permission
on. `expect` turns an UPDATE or DELETE that changed nothing into `NotFound` or `Refused` with the reason.

```sh
# @next on each while only an alpha is published: a plain install gets an older one
npm install @rowstile/client@next @rowstile/drizzle@next
npm install --save-dev rowstile@next      # the command: rowstile dev, rowstile migrate
```

```ts
import { expect as drizzleExpect, inIds, withAuthz } from "@rowstile/drizzle";

    const d = drizzle(p);
    const a = withAuthz(d);
      const editable = await a.transaction((tx) => tx.select({ id: projects.id }).from(projects).where(inIds(projects.id, "project", "edit")), "3");
```

A DELETE the rules refuse deletes 0 rows, without an error; `expect` asks the database why:

```ts
      await expect(a.transaction(async (tx) => drizzleExpect(tx, await tx.delete(notes).where(eq(notes.id, 1)).returning(),
        "app.notes", "delete", 1), "3")).rejects.toBeRefused("delete");
```

## Good to know

- `transaction(fn, who)` signs in as `who`, or as whoever `actingAs` set (`@rowstile/client`), else nobody.
- A query outside a signed-in transaction fails; `translate(e)` makes that error `NotSignedIn`.
- Policy changes ship in Drizzle Kit's journal: `tool = "drizzle"` in `rowstile.toml`, then
  `npx rowstile migrate`.
