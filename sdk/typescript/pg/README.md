# @rowstile/pg

[rowstile](https://rowstile.dev) is a policy language for PostgreSQL. You write who may see and change each
row in one file, and it becomes row-level security: the database filters every read and refuses every write
the rules don't allow, whatever the code asks.

This package is rowstile for node-postgres (`pg`). `authz(pool)` gives transactions that sign in as whoever
the code acts for, the runtime's calls (`can`, `permsOf`, `list`, `share`), and `expect`, which turns an UPDATE
or DELETE that changed nothing into `NotFound` or `Refused` with the reason. `changes(pool)` is the feed for
live updates.

```sh
# @next on each while only an alpha is published: a plain install gets an older one
npm install @rowstile/client@next @rowstile/pg@next
npm install --save-dev rowstile@next      # the command: rowstile dev, rowstile migrate
```

```ts
import { authz as rowstile } from "@rowstile/pg";

    const p = new pg.Pool({ connectionString: APP });
    const a = rowstile(p);
      expect(await a.transaction(async (c) => (await c.query("SELECT id FROM app.notes ORDER BY id")).rows.map((r) => r.id), "2")).toEqual([2, 3]);
```

`transaction(fn, who)` signs in as `who`, or as whoever `actingAs` set. An UPDATE the rules refuse changes 0
rows, without an error; `expect` asks the database why:

```ts
      await expect(actingAs("3", () => a.transaction(async (c) => {
        const r = await c.query("UPDATE app.notes SET body = 'x' WHERE id = 1");
        return a.expect(r, "app.notes", "update", 1);
      }))).rejects.toBeRefused("update");
```

## Good to know

- Every transaction signs in, even as nobody, and nothing uses a session-level `SET`: pools and poolers in
  transaction mode are safe.
- `await a.check()` at start-up throws `ConnectionProblem` on a connection that skips row-level security (a
  superuser, `BYPASSRLS`, the tables' owner).
- `changes(pool)` needs a connection of its own, straight to Postgres: `LISTEN` hears nothing through a
  pooler in transaction mode.
