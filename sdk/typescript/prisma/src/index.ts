/**
 * rowstile with Prisma (7 and later: driver adapters).
 *
 *     const adapter = signedIn(new PrismaPg({ connectionString }), { user: async () => (await auth())?.user.id });
 *     export const db = new PrismaClient({ adapter }).$extends(authz());
 *
 * `signedIn` wraps the driver adapter, so every transaction Prisma begins (interactive, a nested write) signs
 * in with authz.act_as() as whoever the code acts for (actingAs, a job), else user(), else nobody; a query
 * outside a transaction runs in one of its own. `authz()` turns the answers into errors: an update or delete
 * of a row the user can't see is NotFound (Prisma's P2025), of one they may not change Refused with the
 * reason, a refused create Refused naming the rule, a findUniqueOrThrow or findFirstOrThrow that finds no row
 * NotFound; and adds db.$authz (can, ids, permsOf, ...). It refuses
 * array transactions, $transaction([...]): Prisma starts them from another caller's context.
 *
 * Use the client `$extends(authz())` returns, and only that one: the client it was made from is refused
 * whenever it is used (Prisma answers the findUnique calls of one tick with one query, signed in as whoever
 * called first). That holds inside the app's own extensions too, on either side of authz(): an extension added
 * to the client authz() returns is placed before it, so authz() stays the last one, and every hook of the
 * app's runs once for each call, outside what authz() lets through.
