# @rowstile/prisma

[rowstile](https://rowstile.dev) is a policy language for PostgreSQL. You write who may see and change each
row in one file, and it becomes row-level security: the database filters every read and refuses every write
the rules don't allow, whatever the code asks.

This package is rowstile for Prisma. `signedIn(adapter)` signs every transaction Prisma begins in as the
request's user. `authz()` is a client extension: an update or delete of a row the user can't see is
`NotFound`, of one they may not change `Refused` with the database's reason, and `db.$authz` asks the
questions (`can`, `ids`, `permsOf`, `share`). Prisma 7, with a driver adapter.

```sh
# @next on each while only an alpha is published: a plain install gets an older one
npm install @rowstile/client@next @rowstile/prisma@next
npm install --save-dev rowstile@next      # the command: rowstile dev, rowstile migrate
```

```ts
// src/db.ts
import { PrismaPg } from "@prisma/adapter-pg";
import pg from "pg";
import { authz, signedIn } from "@rowstile/prisma";
import "./authz.gen.ts";                              // the policy's names, for the SDK's types

const url = process.env.ROWSTILE_APP_URL;
export const pool = new pg.Pool({ connectionString: url, max: Number(process.env.PG_POOL_MAX ?? 5) });
export const db = new PrismaClient({ adapter: signedIn(new PrismaPg(pool), { user: requestUser }) }).$extends(authz());
```

`ROWSTILE_APP_URL` is the app's own connection, as the role the policy names. It is never the owner's URL,
which Prisma migrates with: row-level security doesn't apply to a table's owner.

Then the code has no checks. The database filters what a query reads:

```ts
  const notes = await db.note.findMany({ select: { id: true, body: true }, orderBy: { id: "asc" } });
```

and a query by permission is one call:

```ts
  const ids = await db.$authz.ids("project", "edit", Number);
  const projects = await db.project.findMany({ where: { id: { in: ids } }, select: { id: true }, orderBy: { id: "asc" } });
```

## Good to know

- Use the client `$extends(authz())` returns, and only that one.
- `$transaction([...])` is refused: Prisma starts an array's transaction from whichever request came first.
  Use `$transaction(async (tx) => ...)`. Inside it, why a write was refused is asked through the transaction:
  it needs no second connection.
- A `create` reads its row back, so it needs the select rule too. A refusal there is `Refused` naming it.
- Policy changes ship as Prisma migrations: `tool = "prisma"` in `rowstile.toml`, then `npx rowstile migrate`.
