# rowstile: access rules in a policy file, enforced by Postgres

**Authorization inside your Postgres.** Sharing, groups, nested folders and tenants, written in one policy
file and compiled to row-level security. There is no authorization service to run beside the database, and no
permission data to copy into one and keep in step: the rules read the tables your app already has.

![A policy, its tests, a one-word change and what the review says of it, a refused write that says why, and what would grant it](demo/demo.gif)

Write who-can-do-what in one small file, next to the data it depends on. The `rowstile`
command compiles it into plain SQL: views, trigger-maintained tables for inheritance, row-level
security policies, and functions for app code: checks, sharing, "who has access", "why", access
requests, reviews, audit. Each change to the policy ships as a migration for the tool your app
already uses (Alembic, Prisma, Drizzle Kit, plain SQL). Nothing is installed in the database first,
and nothing has to run next to it: any Postgres 16, 17 or 18 works, managed or not, and the owner of
your tables runs the migrations, no superuser needed.

```authz
app role app_user                               -- the Postgres role the app connects as
type user = app.users
type folder = app.folders
  owner  : user   = owner_id                    -- a relation read from a column
  parent : folder = parent_id
  editor : user   = app.folder_editors(folder_id -> user_id)   -- ... or from a link table
  can edit = owner or editor or parent.edit     -- inherited down the tree
  can view = edit
rules app.folders
  select : view
  update : edit
```

The app says who is asking in each transaction and queries its tables as usual; RLS
filters every read and checks every write:

```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT authz.act_as('user', '42');         -- a trusted backend, or:
-- SELECT authz.login_key('ak_...');       -- an API key (optionally limited by scopes)
-- SELECT authz.login_jwt('eyJ...');       -- a JWT from your identity provider
SELECT * FROM app.folders;                             -- only the folders 42 may view
SELECT authz.can('folder', 7, 'edit');                 -- ask directly
SELECT * FROM authz.perms_of('folder', ARRAY['7', '8']);  -- a list's buttons, in one call
COMMIT;
```

## Is it for you?

It fits when:

- your app's data is in one Postgres database;
- who may see or change a row depends on other rows: its owner, the members of a team (teams inside teams), a
  folder or a project that passes access down, a tenant, what people share with each other;
- you were about to add an authorization service and keep it in step with the database, or your hand-written
  row-level security has become hard to test and to change.

It doesn't when:

- what decides access is in several databases, or outside Postgres;
- a browser reads the tables through Supabase's Data API (its roles are not the app role: a backend has to
  sign in);
- one tree takes many moves and links a second (they wait for each other);
- you need an outside audit or a vendor behind it today: rowstile is a 0.x preview with one maintainer.

## Status

rowstile is a 0.x preview. Until 1.0, a minor release may change the language, the `authz.*` functions, the
SDKs and the file formats; each release still upgrades a database from the one before it, and the changelog
says what to do. [What a 0.x release promises](docs/reference/limits.md#what-a-0x-release-promises).

rowstile was called rowfence until 0.1.0-alpha.1; another product had the name first. The
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) says what to change.

## Installing

Only an alpha is published so far, 0.1.0-alpha.5: ask for it.

    npm i -D rowstile@next         # the command with its own Python: a TypeScript app needs none
    pip install --pre rowstile     # the command and the Python SDK: rowstile[fastapi], [sqlalchemy], ...
    docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/work" ghcr.io/rowstile/rowstile:0.1.0-alpha.5 migrate

`npm` brings the Python for Linux (glibc and musl, x64 and arm64), macOS (x64 and arm64) and Windows x64. The
image runs as root unless told otherwise: `-u` makes the files it writes yours. [Installing](docs/installing.md)
has the rest: alphas and release candidates, the extras, the repository.

From this repository, put `core/cli` on `PATH`. `rowstile init` then finds the stack (Next.js, Prisma,
Drizzle, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic), writes `rowstile.toml` for its migration tool, adds the SDK's
packages and says which line to change.
