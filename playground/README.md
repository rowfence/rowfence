# The playground

rowstile in the browser, with nothing installed: write a policy, its tables and its tests, and see Postgres
enforce it. The compiler (`core/authzlib`, standard library only) runs in Pyodide, in a worker; the SQL it
writes runs in PGlite, Postgres 18 in WebAssembly. On each change the policy is compiled, applied to a fresh
database with the tables, and its tests run. A mistake shows its line, its code and the code's page; "Ask as
someone" runs a statement as the app role, signed in as whoever you name, and rolls it back. "Copy link" puts
the whole state in the link.

One thing it can't show is signed sessions. PGlite has a single session, the owner's, and rowstile believes
the owner's settings without a signature: a statement under "Ask as someone" may `SET authz.user_id` and
become someone else. On a server the app role's session is believed only after `authz.act_as()` (the page says
so under the box).

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `core.mjs` | the engine: compile (Pyodide), run and ask (PGlite); the same in the page and in `test.mjs` |
| `compiler.worker.mjs` | the compiler in a worker, so Python starts beside Postgres and typing never waits |
| `playground.mjs`, `index.html` | the page |
| `build.mjs` | writes `dist/`: the page, and `bundle.json` with the compiler and the examples, read from the repository (the getting-started guide's own schema, policy and test; the docs example; the cookbook) |
| `test.mjs` | the engine headless, in Node: every example compiles, applies and passes its tests; asking as someone; mistakes; each run starts from nothing; the SQL is the command's (it runs `core/compile_policy.py`: `PYTHON=...` if `python3` isn't the one) |
| `browser_test.mjs` | the page in headless Chrome or Edge, over the DevTools protocol; also how long loading takes |

```sh
cd playground && npm ci
node test.mjs                          # the engine, headless
node build.mjs && node browser_test.mjs  # the page (SCREENSHOT=page.png to see it)
npx serve dist                         # or any static host
```

Pyodide, PGlite and mermaid (the graph) load from jsDelivr, at the versions `package.json` pins (`test.mjs`
checks the page asks for the same ones). Loading takes about 3.5 s once they are cached, measured in headless
Chrome on the development laptop (the design's limit is 5 s); the first time also downloads about 12 MB.
