# Examples

Complete apps that use rowfence as any outside app would: their own policy, applied from their own

permission checks. Each one's `test.sh` runs its tests in Docker, and CI runs them on every change.

- [`filemanager/`](filemanager/): storing and sharing files. Folders inside folders, sharing with people

- [`messenger/`](messenger/): a WhatsApp-style app. Direct chats and groups, admins, invite links,
  blocking, bots with their own API keys, live updates. FastAPI, React.
