"""File contents in RustFS (any S3-compatible store). The backend writes and deletes objects; browsers
download through links signed only after the file's row was read through row-level security.

A browser uploads to a place of its own (uploads/<key>), never to the object a file points at: the backend
moves the bytes there when the upload is confirmed (accept), and reads their size then. So the signed upload
link, which goes on working for a few minutes, can't change a confirmed file or its size afterwards."""
